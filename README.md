## Key Contents
### 1. System Overview
- AMIS Procurement is a sub-system of MISA’s ERP solution.  
- Supports end-to-end procurement management: purchase requests, approvals, planning, purchase orders, tracking, and payments.  
- End-users include: management, purchasing staff, accounting, and related departments.  

### 2. Business Processes
The system supports 3 main types of procurement workflows:
1. **Procurement by assignment** – executed when there is a direct request from a department.  
2. **Procurement planning** – based on demand forecasts and inventory.  
3. **Procurement by agreement** – based on contracts signed with suppliers.  

Additional features:
- Purchase order management.  
- Master data management (suppliers, items, organizational structure).  
- Reports and procurement analytics.  

### 3. Integration with AMIS CRM
- AMIS CRM captures customer demand and forwards it as purchase requests.  
- AMIS Procurement processes approvals, creates purchase orders, tracks progress, and handles payments.  
- Enables a closed-loop lifecycle from **demand → procurement → payment**.  

### 4. Benefits
